## Comics!

/dev/rage is my attempt at becoming a professional comic writer.

But since my time is precious and my drawing skills rare, I'm using
the ragebuilder. But since it watermarks everything and downsizes the
result, I'm doing screenshots, editing them in GIMP and posting them
here.

With all the frustrations we encounter in the software industry, I
can see this becoming a regular habit, so... enjoy :)
